* `/c/Users/camer/lecture1` <br>
* There is no output because it produces no output when it works. I am already in the directory `lecture1` but since there is no arguments it moved me to my home directory. <br>
*The output is not an error. <br>

## path to a directory

* /c/Users/camer <br>
* There is no output because it produces no output when it works. I am in the home directory and then I go into `lecture1` which is a directory so it works. <br>
* The output is not an error. <br>

## path to a file
* ![Image](https://github.com/camunkefer/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-04-07%20182121.png) <br>
* /c/Users/camer/lecture1 <br>
* My argument was `messages/en-us.txt` which is a file but `cd` is used to switch to another directory. Since that is a file and not a folder, it produced an error. <br>
* The output is an error because `messages/en-us.txt` is not a directory, it is a file. <br>
